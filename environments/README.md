# Environments for API Testing

This folder contains **Postman environment files** designed to simplify and standardize the configuration of variables for different API environments, such as **staging** and **production**. These files ensure consistency in testing across multiple environments.

---

## Available Environment Files

### **1. Production Environment**
- **File**: `production-environment.json`
- **Purpose**:
  - Defines variables for testing the production environment.
  - Ensures that sensitive and live configurations are isolated and properly managed.
- **Variables**:
  - `baseUrl`: API base URL for production (e.g., `https://api.production.example.com`).
  - `authToken`: Authentication token for secure access.
  - `apiKey`: API key for API key-based access control.
  - `userToken`, `adminToken`: Tokens for role-based access control.
  - Cloud-specific variables:
    - AWS: `awsBaseUrl`, `awsSignature`, `bucketName`.
    - Azure: `azureBaseUrl`, `azureToken`, `subscriptionId`, etc.
    - GCP: `gcpToken`, `projectId`, etc.
    - IBM: `ibmToken`, `accountId`, etc.

### **2. Staging Environment**
- **File**: `staging-environment.json`
- **Purpose**:
  - Defines variables for testing the staging environment.
  - Enables safe testing and validation of APIs before deploying to production.
- **Variables**:
  - Similar to the production environment but isolated for staging APIs (e.g., `https://api.staging.example.com` for `baseUrl`).

## How to Use the Environment Files

1. **Import the Environment**:
   - Open Postman.
   - Navigate to the **Environments** section and click **Import**.
   - Upload the relevant environment file (e.g., `production-environment.json`).

2. **Set the Active Environment**:
   - After importing, select the appropriate environment (e.g., "Production Environment") in Postman using the environment dropdown.

3. **Customize Variables**:
   - Update placeholder values (e.g., `authToken`, `apiKey`, etc.) with actual values for your environment.
   - Ensure sensitive production values are securely stored and not exposed.

## Recommended Practices

- **Keep Environments Separate**:
  - Use dedicated environments for **staging**, **production**, and other testing phases to prevent accidental modifications in the wrong environment.
  
- **Use Environment-Specific Variables**:
  - Ensure that all API requests and tests dynamically reference environment variables (e.g., `{{baseUrl}}`) to simplify switching between environments.

- **Secure Sensitive Information**:
  - Store sensitive credentials, such as tokens and API keys, securely. Avoid committing these to version control systems.

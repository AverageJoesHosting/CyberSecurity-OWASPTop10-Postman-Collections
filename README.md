# Cybersecurity Postman Collections

This repository provides a comprehensive suite of **Postman collections** for testing, auditing, and enhancing the security of applications, APIs, and cloud environments. Each collection is meticulously designed to align with the latest **OWASP standards** and other security frameworks, enabling developers, security engineers, and DevOps teams to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities effectively.

---

## **Overview**

This project is a centralized hub for:
- **OWASP Top 10 (2025)**: Testing the most critical web application security risks.
- **OWASP API Security Top 10 (2023)**: Addressing the latest API-specific vulnerabilities.
- **General API Security**: Validating common security measures like authentication, input validation, and transport security.
- **Cloud Security**: Detecting misconfigurations in popular cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP, IBM).
- **Compliance Validation**: Ensuring adherence to standards like SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and GDPR.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automating security testing as part of your development pipeline.

Each collection includes pre-configured test cases, detailed documentation, and examples for seamless integration and customization.

## **Categories**

### **1. OWASP Top 10 (2025)**

The OWASP Top 10 identifies the most critical security risks to web applications. This repository includes collections for each of the following risks:
1. **Broken Access Control**: Testing role- and object-based access controls.
2. **Cryptographic Failures**: Validating encryption configurations, key management, and sensitive data protection.
3. **Injection**: Detecting vulnerabilities like SQL, NoSQL, LDAP, and XSS injection.
4. **Insecure Design**: Identifying architectural flaws and insecure workflows.
5. **Security Misconfiguration**: Checking for default credentials, open ports, and unnecessary services.
6. **Vulnerable and Outdated Components**: Ensuring third-party dependencies are secure and up-to-date.
7. **Identification and Authentication Failures**: Testing multi-factor authentication, session management, and credential validation.
8. **Software and Data Integrity Failures**: Validating the integrity of software packages and data pipelines.
9. **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**: Ensuring proper logging and alerting for suspicious activities.
10. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: Identifying SSRF vulnerabilities in API and backend calls.

### **2. OWASP API Security Top 10 (2023)**

APIs are a critical attack surface in modern applications. This repository includes collections for the following API-specific vulnerabilities:
1. **Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)**
2. **Broken Authentication**
3. **Broken Object Property Level Authorization**
4. **Unrestricted Resource Consumption**
5. **Broken Function Level Authorization**
6. **Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows**
7. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**
8. **Security Misconfiguration**
9. **Improper Inventory Management**
10. **Unsafe Consumption of APIs**

Learn more about these vulnerabilities at the [OWASP API Security Top 10 (2023)](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0x00-header/).

### **3. General API Security**

This category includes templates and tests for common API security measures:
- **Authentication and Authorization**:
  - Validate token-based and API key-based access controls.
  - Test multi-factor authentication (MFA) and role-based access (RBAC).
- **Input Validation and Injection Prevention**:
  - Detect SQL, NoSQL, LDAP, and command injection vulnerabilities.
  - Validate input sanitization and encoding.
- **Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention**:
  - Test rate-limiting mechanisms and responses to excessive requests.
- **Error Handling and Information Disclosure**:
  - Ensure error responses do not expose sensitive details.
- **Transport Security**:
  - Validate HTTPS enforcement and proper TLS configurations.

---

### **4. Cloud Security**

This section provides collections to test security configurations across popular cloud platforms:
1. **AWS Security**:
   - Validate IAM roles, S3 bucket ACLs, and AWS KMS key configurations.
2. **Azure Security**:
   - Test resource group access, storage account configurations, and Key Vault security.
3. **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Security**:
   - Validate IAM policies, storage bucket settings, and encryption key management.
4. **IBM Cloud Security**:
   - Test resource access policies, COS bucket ACLs, and encryption configurations.

Additionally, general collections for **Data Security**, **Logging & Monitoring**, and **Secure Configurations** ensure broader cloud security validation.

---

### **5. Compliance Validation**

Pre-configured collections for testing against industry standards:
- **SOC 2**: Ensure data security, availability, and confidentiality requirements are met.
- **HIPAA**: Validate compliance with healthcare security and privacy rules.
- **PCI-DSS**: Test configurations for payment card data security.
- **GDPR**: Ensure data handling meets privacy and security requirements for personal data.

---

### **6. CI/CD Integration**

The repository includes scripts and workflows to automate security testing as part of CI/CD pipelines. The `/scripts/ci-cd-integration/` folder provides:
- **`run-collections.js`**:
  - Automates the execution of Postman collections with Newman.
  - Generates JSON and HTML reports for analysis.
- **GitHub Actions Workflow**:
  - Example configuration for running tests on every commit or pull request.
- **Jenkins Pipeline Script**:
  - Parallel execution of collections with reporting and Slack notifications.

Refer to the `/scripts/ci-cd-integration/README.md` for detailed setup instructions.

---

## **Usage**

### **1. Import Collections**
- Navigate to the `/collections/` directory and download the desired collections.
- Import them into Postman using the **Import** feature.

### **2. Configure Environments**
- Use the environment files from the `/environments/` directory (`production-environment.json`, `staging-environment.json`).
- Configure variables such as:
  - `baseUrl`: API base URL.
  - `authToken`, `apiKey`: Credentials for authentication.
  - Cloud-specific variables (e.g., `bucketName`, `subscriptionId`).

### **3. Run Tests**
- Execute collections individually or batch-run them using:
  - Postmanâ€™s **Collection Runner**.
  - The provided `run-collections.js` script with Newman.

### **4. Analyze Results**
- Review test results in CLI, JSON, or HTML formats.
- Use reporting tools to identify and address vulnerabilities.

## Overview

**Cybersecurity Postman Collections** is a comprehensive suite developed by **Average Joe's Hosting LLC** that provides a collection of **Postman collections** tailored for testing, auditing, and enhancing the security of applications, APIs, and cloud environments. These collections are meticulously designed to align with the latest **OWASP standards** and other prominent security frameworks, enabling users to efficiently identify and mitigate vulnerabilities within their systems.

- **OWASP Top 10 (2025):** Collections to test critical web application risks.
- **OWASP API Security Top 10 (2023):** API-specific security testing collections.
- **General API Security:** Validate authentication, input validation, transport security, and more.
- **Cloud Security:** Collections to detect misconfigurations in AWS, Azure, GCP, and IBM Cloud.
- **Compliance Validation:** Preconfigured collections for SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and GDPR.

### ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Integration
- **Automation Scripts:** Seamlessly integrate security tests into your CI/CD pipelines using scripts and workflows.

- **Reporting:** Generate JSON and HTML reports for easy analysis and documentation.

### üõ°Ô∏è Benchmarking and Scoring
- **OWASP Alignment:** Ensure your security measures meet the latest OWASP standards.
- **Custom Scoring:** Implement scoring mechanisms to prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity and impact.

### üìÇ Organized Structure
- **Modular Collections:** Each security category is organized into separate Postman collections for targeted testing.
- **Reusable Components:** Utilize shared environments and variables across multiple collections to streamline testing processes.

### üìù Documentation and Support
- **Detailed README:** Comprehensive instructions and guidelines to help you get started quickly.
- **Support Scripts:** Helper scripts to facilitate environment setup and test execution.

## üìÇ Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AverageJoesHosting/CyberSecurity-OWASPTop10-Postman-Collections.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd CyberSecurity-OWASPTop10-Postman-Collections
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure you have [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) installed. For CI/CD integration, install [Newman](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman):
   ```bash
   npm install -g newman
   ```

## üíª Usage

Execute the Postman collections using the Postman interface or automate them with Newman.

### 1. **Import Collections**
- Open Postman.
- Click on **Import** and select the desired collections from the `/collections/` directory.

### 2. **Configure Environments**
- Import environment files located in the `/environments/` directory (`staging`, `production`, etc.).
- Set variables such as `baseUrl`, `authToken`, and `apiKey` as required.

### 3. **Run Tests**
- **Via Postman:**
  - Use the **Collection Runner** to execute the imported collections.
- **Via Newman:**
  - Execute collections from the command line for automation:
    ```bash
    newman run /path/to/collection.json -e /path/to/environment.json -r html,json
    ```

### 4. **Review Results**
- Analyze results directly in Postman or review the generated JSON and HTML reports for comprehensive insights.

## üîñ Example Commands

- **Run OWASP Top 10 Collection with Newman:**
  ```bash
  newman run collections/OWASP_Top_10_Postman_Collection.json -e environments/staging.postman_environment.json -r html,json
  ```

- **Run API Security Top 10 Collection in Production:**
  ```bash
  newman run collections/OWASP_API_Security_Top_10_Postman_Collection.json -e environments/production.postman_environment.json -r html,json
  ```

- **Automate Tests in CI/CD Pipeline:**
  Integrate the following script into your GitHub Actions or Jenkins pipeline to automate security testing:
  ```bash
  newman run collections/OWASP_Top_10_Postman_Collection.json -e environments/staging.postman_environment.json -r html,json --reporter-html-export reports/owasp_top10_report.html --reporter-json-export reports/owasp_top10_report.json
  ```

# Templates for API Security Testing

This folder contains reusable **Postman test templates** for common API security scenarios. These templates can be used across multiple collections to ensure consistency and thoroughness in API testing.

---

## Available Templates

### **1. Authentication Tests**
- **File**: `auth-tests.json`
- **Purpose**:
  - Validate token-based authentication.
  - Enforce API key-based access control.
  - Ensure unauthorized access is properly denied.
- **Scenarios**:
  - Access granted with valid token.
  - Access granted with valid API key.
  - Unauthorized requests result in appropriate `401 Unauthorized` responses.

### **2. Input Validation Tests**
- **File**: `input-validation-tests.json`
- **Purpose**:
  - Test input sanitization and validation mechanisms.
  - Identify and prevent injection vulnerabilities.
- **Scenarios**:
  - Block SQL injection attempts.
  - Prevent command injection attacks.
  - Validate proper sanitization of potentially dangerous inputs, such as HTML or JavaScript.

## How to Use the Templates

1. **Import the Template**:
   - Open Postman.
   - Navigate to the **Import** button and select the desired template JSON file.
2. **Customize the Variables**:
   - Set the `baseUrl` and other required variables to match your API environment.
   - Replace placeholder values (e.g., `authToken`, `apiKey`) with actual values.
3. **Integrate into Your Collections**:
   - Copy relevant requests and tests from the template into your own collections.
   - Modify the requests and tests to suit your API's specific endpoints and behavior.

## Recommended Use Cases

- **Authentication Tests**:
  - Use in any API project to validate security around authentication mechanisms.
  - Integrate into CI/CD pipelines to monitor API security continuously.

- **Input Validation Tests**:
  - Include in collections where user input is processed to ensure injection vulnerabilities are mitigated.
  - Apply to endpoints that handle forms, query parameters, or JSON payloads.

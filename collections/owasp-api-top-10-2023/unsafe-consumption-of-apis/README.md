# Unsafe Consumption of APIs Postman Collections

This section contains Postman collections for testing **Unsafe Consumption of APIs**, a critical risk identified in the **OWASP API Security Top 10 (2023)**. These vulnerabilities arise when applications consume external APIs without proper validation, error handling, or security measures, potentially exposing systems to malicious or unexpected behavior.

---

## üìÇ **Included Collections**

### **1. Handling Unexpected API Responses**
- **File**: `unexpected-responses.json`
- **Purpose**:
  - Validate that the application properly handles unexpected or malicious responses from third-party APIs.
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Simulate receiving malformed or unexpected data from an external API.
  - Ensure the application does not crash or expose sensitive information when processing these responses.

---

### **2. Consuming APIs with Insecure Transport**
- **File**: `insecure-transport.json`
- **Purpose**:
  - Detect if the application consumes APIs over insecure channels (e.g., HTTP instead of HTTPS).
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Attempt to call external APIs using HTTP.
  - Validate that insecure transport is blocked or discouraged with appropriate error messages.

---

### **3. Trusting Unvalidated Data**
- **File**: `unvalidated-data.json`
- **Purpose**:
  - Ensure that data returned by third-party APIs is properly validated before being processed or stored.
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Fetch potentially untrusted data from an external API.
  - Validate that the application sanitizes or rejects malformed or malicious data.

---

### **4. Error Handling in External API Consumption**
- **File**: `error-handling.json`
- **Purpose**:
  - Ensure that errors from external APIs are handled gracefully without exposing sensitive information or impacting application stability.
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Trigger error responses from external APIs and validate that they are properly logged and managed.

---

## üöÄ **How to Use**

### **1. Import Collections**
- Import the desired JSON file(s) from this directory into Postman.

### **2. Configure Environment Variables**
- Set up the following variables in your Postman environment:
  - `externalApiUrl`: The base URL of the external API (e.g., `https://external-api.example.com`).
  - `apiToken`: Authentication token for accessing the external API.

### **3. Run Tests**
- Execute tests using Postman‚Äôs **Collection Runner** or via Newman CLI:
  ```bash
  newman run collection.json --environment environment.json
  ```

### **4. Analyze Results**
- Review test results to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in the way APIs are consumed.
- Apply the recommended mitigations to secure your API consumption practices.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Key Features**

### **Response Handling Validation**
- Ensures the application can handle unexpected, malformed, or malicious responses from third-party APIs.

### **Transport Security**
- Tests whether APIs are consumed securely using HTTPS.

### **Data Validation**
- Validates that untrusted data from external APIs is sanitized and validated before use.

### **Error Management**
- Ensures that error responses from external APIs are managed securely without exposing sensitive information.

## üìÑ **Best Practices for Mitigation**

1. **Validate and Sanitize External Data**:
   - Always validate and sanitize data returned by external APIs before using it in your application.
   - Use schemas or allowlists to restrict acceptable data formats.
2. **Enforce Secure Transport**:
   - Consume APIs over HTTPS to ensure data in transit is encrypted.
   - Reject insecure HTTP connections.
3. **Implement Proper Error Handling**:
   - Catch and handle errors from external APIs gracefully.
   - Log errors securely and avoid exposing sensitive information in responses.
4. **Test External API Dependencies**:
   - Regularly test third-party APIs to ensure they meet security standards.
   - Monitor changes to third-party APIs to avoid unexpected behavior.

# Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows Postman Collections

This section contains Postman collections for testing **Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows**, a critical risk identified in the **OWASP API Security Top 10 (2023)**. These vulnerabilities occur when APIs fail to enforce proper access controls for sensitive business workflows, allowing unauthorized or unintended actions that could compromise system integrity or data security.

---

## üìÇ **Included Collections**

### **1. Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Business Flow**
- **File**: `unauthorized-business-flow.json`
- **Purpose**:
  - Validate that sensitive business workflows, such as fund transfers, cannot be accessed without proper authorization.
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Attempt a fund transfer operation using a non-privileged token.
  - Ensure unauthorized access is denied with appropriate error messages (e.g., `403 Forbidden`).

---

### **2. Abuse of Bulk Operations**
- **File**: `bulk-operation-abuse.json`
- **Purpose**:
  - Detect vulnerabilities where bulk operations (e.g., mass deletions) can be executed without sufficient restrictions.
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Attempt to delete all resources in bulk without proper authorization.
  - Validate that the API blocks such operations and logs the attempt.

---

### **3. Lack of Workflow Restrictions**
- **File**: `workflow-restriction.json`
- **Purpose**:
  - Ensure that sensitive business workflows (e.g., account upgrades or status changes) are properly restricted.
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Attempt to change account types or statuses without sufficient privileges.
  - Validate that unauthorized modifications are denied with proper error responses.

## üöÄ **How to Use**

### **1. Import Collections**
- Import the desired JSON file(s) from this directory into Postman.

### **2. Configure Environment Variables**
- Set up the following variables in your Postman environment:
  - `baseUrl`: The API's base URL (e.g., `https://api.example.com`).
  - `userToken`: Authentication token for user-level access.

### **3. Run Tests**
- Execute tests using Postman‚Äôs **Collection Runner** or via Newman CLI:
  ```bash
  newman run collection.json --environment environment.json
  ```

### **4. Analyze Results**
- Review test results to ensure sensitive business workflows are protected against unauthorized access or abuse.
- Address any vulnerabilities by implementing strict access controls and monitoring mechanisms.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Key Features**

### **Access Control for Sensitive Workflows**
- Validates that only authorized users can perform sensitive operations, such as fund transfers or bulk deletions.

### **Abuse Prevention for Bulk Operations**
- Ensures bulk actions are restricted to prevent accidental or malicious misuse.

### **Workflow Integrity**
- Detects vulnerabilities in workflows, ensuring they are protected against unauthorized changes or tampering.

## üìÑ **Best Practices for Mitigation**

1. **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - Restrict access to sensitive workflows based on user roles and permissions.
2. **Validate Input Parameters**:
   - Sanitize and validate request payloads to ensure only authorized fields and actions are allowed.
3. **Log and Monitor Sensitive Operations**:
   - Log all sensitive workflow operations and monitor for anomalies or unauthorized access attempts.
4. **Deny by Default**:
   - Default to denying access to sensitive workflows unless explicitly permitted.
5. **Add Workflow Approval Processes**:
   - Require multi-level approvals for sensitive operations, such as fund transfers or bulk deletions.

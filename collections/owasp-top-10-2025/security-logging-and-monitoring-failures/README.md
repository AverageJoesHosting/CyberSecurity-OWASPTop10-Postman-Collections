# Security Logging and Monitoring Failures Postman Collections

This section contains Postman collections for testing **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**, a critical risk identified in the **OWASP Top 10 (2025)**. Inadequate logging, monitoring, and alerting mechanisms hinder an organization‚Äôs ability to detect and respond to security incidents effectively.

---

## üìÇ **Included Collections**

### **1. Insufficient Logging**
- **File**: `insufficient-logging.json`
- **Purpose**:
  - Identify endpoints that fail to log important security events, such as failed login attempts or unauthorized access.
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Verify that failed login attempts are properly logged and retrievable via log APIs.

---

### **2. Missing Alerts**
- **File**: `missing-alerts.json`
- **Purpose**:
  - Detect the absence of alerts for critical security events.
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Trigger a suspicious or high-risk action (e.g., attempting to delete all users) and validate that an alert is generated.

---

### **3. Log Tampering Detection**
- **File**: `log-tampering.json`
- **Purpose**:
  - Ensure that logs cannot be deleted or modified by unauthorized users.
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Attempt to delete logs without sufficient permissions and validate that the action is denied.

## üöÄ **How to Use**

### **1. Import Collections**
- Import the desired JSON file(s) from this directory into Postman.

### **2. Configure Environment Variables**
- Set up required variables in your Postman environment:
  - `baseUrl`: The API's base URL (e.g., `https://api.example.com`).
  - `logApiUrl`: The API endpoint for retrieving or managing logs.
  - `adminToken`: An admin authentication token for validating logs and alerts.
  - `userToken`: A non-privileged user token for testing unauthorized actions.

### **3. Run Tests**
- Execute tests using Postman‚Äôs **Collection Runner** or via Newman CLI:
  ```bash
  newman run collection.json --environment environment.json
  ```

### **4. Analyze Results**
- Review test results to identify missing logging or alerting mechanisms.
- Implement necessary changes to ensure sufficient logging, monitoring, and tamper-resistance.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Key Features**

### **Event Logging Validation**
- Ensures that important security events (e.g., failed logins, unauthorized actions) are properly logged.

### **Alert Generation**
- Validates that alerts are triggered for high-risk or suspicious actions.
- Ensures that alerts contain relevant details (e.g., severity, action type).

### **Log Tampering Prevention**
- Checks that logs cannot be modified or deleted without proper permissions.
- Validates the integrity of logs against tampering attempts.

## üìÑ **Best Practices for Mitigation**

1. **Implement Comprehensive Logging**:
   - Log all critical security events, such as authentication failures, unauthorized access attempts, and administrative actions.
2. **Enable Real-Time Alerts**:
   - Trigger alerts for high-severity events (e.g., privilege escalation, critical data changes).
   - Route alerts to appropriate monitoring systems for immediate response.
3. **Secure Logs Against Tampering**:
   - Enforce access controls on log files and APIs.
   - Use cryptographic techniques (e.g., hashing) to ensure log integrity.
4. **Regularly Monitor Logs**:
   - Automate log analysis to detect anomalies or suspicious patterns.
   - Integrate logs into SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools.

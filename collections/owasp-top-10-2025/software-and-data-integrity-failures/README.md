# Software and Data Integrity Failures Postman Collections

This section contains Postman collections for testing **Software and Data Integrity Failures**, as outlined in the **OWASP Top 10 (2025)**. These vulnerabilities arise when data integrity, software updates, or application workflows are compromised, potentially leading to unauthorized changes or system compromise.

---

## üìÇ **Included Collections**

### **1. Data Tampering Validation**
- **File**: `data-tampering.json`
- **Purpose**:
  - Detect vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized modification of sensitive data.
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Attempt to modify sensitive information (e.g., account balance) without proper authorization.
  - Validate that unauthorized changes are blocked.

---

### **2. Software Package Integrity Validation**
- **File**: `package-integrity.json`
- **Purpose**:
  - Verify the integrity of downloaded software packages.
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Compare the hash of a downloaded package with the expected hash.
  - Ensure the package has not been tampered with during transit.

---

### **3. Insecure Update Mechanisms**
- **File**: `insecure-updates.json`
- **Purpose**:
  - Identify weaknesses in update mechanisms, such as lack of source verification or integrity checks.
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Validate that updates are signed and verified before installation.
  - Check that downloaded update files match expected hash values.

---

## üöÄ **How to Use**

### **1. Import Collections**
- Import the desired JSON file(s) from this directory into Postman.

### **2. Configure Environment Variables**
- Set up required variables in your Postman environment:
  - `baseUrl`: The API's base URL (e.g., `https://api.example.com`).
  - Replace placeholder values, such as expected hash values, with actual data.

### **3. Run Tests**
- Execute tests using Postman‚Äôs **Collection Runner** or via Newman CLI:
  ```bash
  newman run collection.json --environment environment.json
  ```

### **4. Analyze Results**
- Review test results to identify issues with data integrity, software verification, or update mechanisms.
- Implement necessary changes to address detected vulnerabilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Key Features**

### **Data Integrity Validation**
- Ensures that sensitive data cannot be modified without proper authorization.
- Tests for potential vulnerabilities in data workflows.

### **Software Verification**
- Validates the integrity of software packages using cryptographic hash checks.
- Detects tampering or corruption in downloaded files.

### **Secure Update Mechanisms**
- Ensures that updates are signed and verified.
- Detects insecure update mechanisms that could allow malicious software to be installed.

## üìÑ **Best Practices for Mitigation**

1. **Implement Integrity Checks**:
   - Use cryptographic hash functions (e.g., SHA-256) to verify the integrity of software and data.
2. **Secure Update Mechanisms**:
   - Require signed updates with public/private key verification.
   - Reject updates from unverified sources.
3. **Restrict Unauthorized Modifications**:
   - Use role-based access controls (RBAC) to restrict modifications to sensitive data.
4. **Monitor Data Changes**:
   - Log and alert on unauthorized or unusual data modifications.

## Step 1: Download the Collection
1. Navigate to the `collections/` directory in the repository.
2. Locate the collection you want to use. For example:
   - `collections/owasp-api-top-10-2023/broken-object-level-auth/bola-collection.json`
3. Download the JSON file for the collection to your local machine.

## Step 2: Open Postman

   - Go to the **Environments** tab in Postman.
   - Create a new environment or edit an existing one.
   - Add variables such as `baseUrl` and their respective values.
2. Select the appropriate environment before running the collection.
